 * @brief    Low level, platform dependant, part for communicate with ESP module and platform.
 * @{
 *
 * This is a low-level part of ESP module library.
 *
 * It provides communication between ESP module and platform. There are some function, which needs to be implemented by user and with care.
 *
 * \par U(S)ART configuration
 *
 * ESP8266 module works with U(S)ART communication with device. For this purpose, library supposes 2, USART based, functions, which are called from ESP module stack when needed:
 *
 * - \ref ESP8266_LL_USARTInit: Function, which is called when USART should be initialized
 * - \ref ESP8266_LL_USARTSend: Function, which is called when data should be sent to ESP8266 device
 *
 * ESP stack module does not check for any incoming data from ESP8266 module to USART of your device.
 *
 * Most microcontrollers have USART RX capability, so when USART RX interrupt happens,
 * you should send this received byte to ESP8266 module using @ref ESP8266_DataReceived function to notify new incoming data.
 * Use interrupt handler routing to notify new data using previous mentioned function.
 * 
 * \par Reset configuration
 *
 * ESP8266 module can be reset using AT commands. However, it may happen that ESP module ignores AT commands for some reasons.
 *
 * You need to implement 3 macros or functions for GPIO capability for reset purpose.
 *
 * Take a look for \ref ESP8266_RESET_INIT, \ref ESP8266_RESET_LOW and \ref ESP8266_RESET_HIGH functions.
 *
 * \par Time configuration
 *
 * ESP module part needs current time in milliseconds to take care of any possible timeouts on connections and similar things.
 *
 * You need to implement your own time source (systick interrupt, normal timer with interrupt capability, etc) to tell ESP stack current time.
 *
 * Use @ref ESP8266_TimeUpdate to notify ESP stack with new time.
 *
 * \par Dependencies
